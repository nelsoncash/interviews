# Coding questions and links for NC Interviews

## Web App Coding Challenge

Create a dynamic web page/app that given a JSON file, can display a user interface which offers a header, a scrollable list and a detail modal.

## Requirements
* Stay as close to the following designs as possible (/angular/FE-Test.jpg). We get it, we're giving you flat design assets so don't sweat exact colors and font-sizes.
* The application should consume the `http://s3.amazonaws.com/nc-interview-data/angular/articles.json` from an external file and dynamically generate and template the results.
* Clicking "Learn More" should open a modal which displays the related details “title" and “description”.

## Solution
* Use any open source tools you wish to satisfy the requirements.
* Add any needed instructions.
* Upload your solution to either a Google Drive link (.zip) or put code on a plunkr https://plnkr.co/.

## Notes
* This is your opportunity to show off your preferred project structure, framework and/or tooling.
* Would anything here make sense to unit test?
* Use [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) from Google Fonts.
